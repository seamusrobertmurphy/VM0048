Guide to Verra's VM0048 consolidated methodology and VMD0055-compliant emissions reporting:

1.  Baseline Calculation: We perform comprehensive baseline emissions calculations using workflows for satellite-based forest monitoring. Our workflow uses Google Earth Engine to process Landsat Collection-2 Analysis-Ready-Data, including cloud-masking and atmospheric corrections.

2.  Deforestation Risk & Spatial Modeling: We design and implement deforestation risk mapping and spatial covariate index development. This includes analyzing spatial data like roads, settlements, and slope to support accurate emissions accounting.

3.  Leakage Analysis: We delineate VMD0055-compliant leakage belts and perform masking to exclude areas ineligible for leakage accounting, such as steep slopes or protected lands.
